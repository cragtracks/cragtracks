This hike takes place in the heart of Lagorai mountain group. It starts from rifugio Carlettini (1360m) with plenty of parking available there.
There is also a possibility to park 1.5km further and shorten the hike. 

The hike then goes to the North, following a marked path to a place called Laghi di Rocco (2130m). Right at that spot there is no lake, but just above
it to the West there are laghi delle Buse Basse, also there are several passes around, so the original path can be creatively extendend for 
your satisfaction. After Laghi di Rocco the hike turns to the East and reaches passo Val Cion (2076m).
From there it descends to back to rifugio Carlettini but this time it takes a forest road on the other side of the valley thus completing the circle.

The entire length is 15km with 900m of altitude gain.

## Why to do this hike?

The main reason are the Lagorai themselves: peculiar mountains, wild, almost untouched by industrial tourism. The ambience of Lagorai is also peculiar,
the rock type is often porphyry or granite, which is different from dolomites and limestone. From the higher parts of the hike one can see the higher
mountains of Lagorai, including Cima d'Asta.

This particular hike can be extendened to pleasure, because it opens opportunities to reach forcella Valsorda (2256m), the lakes of Buse Basse, and others.
