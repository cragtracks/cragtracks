## Why to do this hike?

The main reason are the Lagorai themselves: peculiar mountains, wild, almost untouched by industrial tourism. The ambience of Lagorai is also peculiar,
the rock type is often porphyry or granite, which is different from dolomites and limestone. From the higher parts of the hike one can see the higher
mountains of Lagorai, including Cima d'Asta.

This particular hike can be extendened to pleasure, because it opens opportunities to reach forcella Valsorda (2256m), the lakes of Buse Basse, and others.
