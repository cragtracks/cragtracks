# About the area

Valle dei Mocheni is a rather narrow valley which allows for a several easy
yet quite enjoyable hikes.

The two that I will share below start from the same point, a paid parking lot
in the end of the valley, in Palu' del Fersina. There is also a free parking lot which is located some 20 minutes by walk away.

## Rifugio Sette Selle and passo Garofani

### Track and info

Free parking: [location](https://goo.gl/maps/K9bogpG7TEk93Tj59)

This hike starts from the paid parking (1500m) and climbs East to Rifugio Sette Selle 
(2014m, 46.13232 11.39235) mostly 
following well marked path. As of end of March, 2023, the Rifugio was open 
(also for spending the night), which is noteworthy because it is not 
directly reacheable by car. In front of the rifugio there is a quite cozy 
picnic area with benches and tables.

From the rifugio it is possible to reach several of the many passes or summits. 
This hike goes in Western direction, climbing another 200m by a path until 
passo del Garofani, which offers splendid views on the valley, the 
mountains of Sette Selle, and surroundings.

Track details (one way):

- Altitude gain: 470m to Rifugio Sette Selle, 670m to passo del Garofani.
- Length: 2.7 km to Rifugio Sette Selle, 3.5 to passo del Garofani.

Both ways will be around 700m uphill, 700m downhill, and 7 km.

### Why going here

As other areas in Lagorai, this valley is rather wild and characteristic.

## Lago di Erdemolo

### Track and info

Paid parking: [location](https://goo.gl/maps/Lrj9tnWJzViXAJ7g9)

Free parking: [location](https://goo.gl/maps/K9bogpG7TEk93Tj59)

This hike starts from the same paid parking (1500m) as the track above, 
and climbs South following a paved road for 1.5km until location Maso Lenzi,
from where a well marked and quite steep path starts.

The path continues in the Southern direction and brings to the Erdemolo
lake (2000m). This may be very well the final destination of the hike,
although the location also allows for creative continuation.

This hike adds another 200m of altitude gain to bring to passo del Lago (2200m),
which is located to the South from the lake. The area of the pass offers
panoramic views on Lagorai mountains and Valsugana.

Track details (one way):

- Altitude gain: 530m to Lago di Erdemolo, 750m to passo del Lago.
- Length: 3km to Lago di Erdemolo, 4km to passo del Lago.

Both ways will be around 800m uphill and 800m downhill, 8 km.

### Why coming here

As other areas in Lagorai, this valley is rather wild and characteristic.
Adding the passo del Lago to the hike allows to enjoy panoramic views of other areas
of Lagorai.
