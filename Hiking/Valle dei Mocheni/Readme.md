## About the area

Valle dei Mocheni is a rather narrow valley which allows for a several easy
yet quite enjoyable hikes.

The two that I will share below start from the same point, a paid parking lot
in the end of the valley, in Palu' del Fersina. There is also a free parking lot which is located some 20 minutes by walk away.

## Rifugio Sette Selle and passo Garofani
