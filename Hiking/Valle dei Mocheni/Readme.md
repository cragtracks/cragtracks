# About the area

Valle dei Mocheni is a rather narrow valley which allows for a several easy
yet quite enjoyable hikes.

The two that I will share below start from the same point, a paid parking lot
in the end of the valley, in Palu' del Fersina. There is also a free parking lot which is located some 20 minutes by walk away.

This hike starts from a paid parking (1500m) and climbs to Rifugio Sette Selle 
(2014m, 46.13232 11.39235) mostly 
following well marked path. As of end of March, 2023, the Rifugio was open 
(also for spending the night), which is noteworthy because it is not 
directly reacheable by car. In front of the rifugio there is a quite cozy 
picnic area with benches and tables.

From the rifugio it is possible to reach several of the many passes or summits. 
This hike goes in Western direction, climbing another 200m by a path until 
passo del Garofani, which offers splendid views on the valley, the 
mountains of Sette Selle, and surroundings.

Track details (one way):

- Altitude gain: 470m to Rifugio Sette Selle, 670m to passo del Garofani.
- Length: 2.7 km to Rifugio Sette Selle, 3.5 to passo del Garofani.

### Why going here

As other areas in Lagorai, this valley is rather wild and characteristic.
